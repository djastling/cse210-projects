Budgeting App

This is my final project, which is an app that allows you to set bugets, import your monthly transactions and track your spending over time

First, you must import your transactions in a csv file (most banks have this option). 
Each bank has a different format for their csv files, I have options to import from ICCU, AFCU and HAPO though adding more banks wouldn't be very difficult
Then you can view those transactions, save them to a file or compare them to your budget.

You can set a budget in the app, which will go through each category of spending. 
If you import transactions, you can view your budget and see if you went over or stayed under your set budget. 
You can then save these to files based on the month you are tracking so that at the beginning and end of each month, you can evaluate the last month and set goals for the new month

Once you are done, you can exit by entering 7 in the menu.

Thank you!
